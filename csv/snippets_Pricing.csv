2025-07-03 10:00:12+00:00,African Impact Initiative <canada@africanimpactinitiative.com>,What a glorious Demo Day! Here's Why.,"https://africanimpact.ca
Greetings Agnes,
June has been a whirlwind—our team mobilized across the board, refining pitches, perfecting slides, and syncing logistics in preparation for AIC Virtual Demo Day 2025 on June 27. It truly was an “all-in” moment: from mentors to organizers, to investors and our founders, each one played a part, ensuring a seamless virtual experience for our 100+ attendees from around the globe.
Let’s dive into the highlights!
AIC Virtual Demo Day 2025 Recap
With over a hundred participants tuning in live, our virtual auditorium buzzed with enthusiasm and energy. From Nairobi to Gabon, Lagos to Toronto, stakeholders united to witness groundbreaking pitches across three streams.
The Health Entrepreneurship Stream (https://www.africanimpact.ca/hent) is one of the African Impact Challenge (https://www.africanimpact.ca/our-initiatives#african-impact-challenge) streams that is specifically catered to health innovations from across the African continent. In this year’s virtual demo day we had 11 ventures competing for the HENT award which included a cash price of $2,000, the Country Innovation stream is a sector agnostic stream that is based off the African Impact Challenge country of focus, which was Botswana for our 2024 cohort and we had 5 ventures competing for a $2,000 CAD  and our final award was the Audience choice award that the attendees actively participated in selecting.
Let’s dive into a highlight of the winners:
** UltraTeb- Health Entrepreneurship Stream Winner
------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyKDdYygd7M
UltraTeb (https://ultrateb.com/) is the first electronically financed trade platform for medical consumables and supplies.
UltraTeb (https://ultrateb.com/) is developing a B2B e-commerce platform for the medical supplies industry that connects vendors directly with healthcare providers. By eliminating intermediaries, the platform reduces costs and enhances efficiency. It also integrates financial solutions to streamline the purchasing process.
** Perfect Order- Country Innovation Stream Winner
------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8OMDKN0wts&t=50s
Perfect Order (https://www.perfectorder.shop/) is a tech startup based in Botswana that is dedicated to empowering individuals to enter the ecommerce ecosystem with minimal effort.
Leveraging USSD, a simple text-based mobile network technology, it enables users to sell across multiple channels, expand their customer base, and increase revenue. By harnessing the reach of mobile networks, the platform provides an inclusive, affordable solution for entrepreneurs.
Through a local short code (*250#), sellers can easily create stores, list products or services, and instantly receive a website link, mobile network shortcode, WhatsApp chatbot, and QR code, all in seconds. The platform makes stores accessible across multiple sales channels, allowing customers to place orders and make payments using their preferred method. This solution empowers non tech-savvy entrepreneurs to confidently engage in the global ecommerce ecosystem.
** Glotto- Audience Choice Award Winner
------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4rx1PZqGq4&t=5s
Glotto (https://glottobrand.com/about-us/) is a minimalist clothing brand that is inspired by the robust earth tones and textures of the Sub Saharan fauna and flora. GLOTTO is a name derived from the word Glottology; the study of linguistics… the study of tongues. A creative brand that is designed and crafted to capture the spirit of the evolved hunter and gatherer; an individual that is on the constant hunt for knowledgeable means of expression whilst simultaneously gathering inherited lessons to consciously navigate our global village.
** Alumni Success Story: Motobrix: Transforming Waste into Clean Energy for Kenyan Communities
------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mraJEAJ8CrM&t=21s
In the heart of Mathare, Nairobi, Motobrix (https://www.facebook.com/Motobrixlimited/) is pioneering a sustainable solution to energy poverty and environmental degradation. This social enterprise collects organic waste and transforms it into clean, affordable briquettes, providing a reliable energy source for slum-dwellers. By converting waste into fuel, Motobrix (https://www.facebook.com/Motobrixlimited/) not only addresses waste management challenges but also offers an eco-friendly alternative to traditional charcoal and wood, contributing to climate action and community empowerment.
Supported by the African Impact Initiative (https://www.africanimpact.ca/) through the 2021 African Impact Challenge (https://www.africanimpact.ca/african-impact-challenge-2021) , Motobrix exemplifies youth-led innovation driving positive change in Africa.

My name is Maina Njau, and I’m reaching out to introduce **LatensLink** — a lead generation system built around intelligent targeting, trusted sources, and clean delivery.

📄 **Proposal** – Overview of our lead generation service, system strengths, delivery formats, and pricing  
📷 **Visual System Report** – Screenshots of a real deployment: terminal logs, source targeting, email extraction, and packaging
LatensLink doesn’t “scrape” or guess. We use an algorithmic approach to target trusted business directories, private websites, and niche listings based on your industry.  
No noise. No clutter. Just verified, ready-to-contact leads delivered in branded Excel and TXT format.
In short:
✅ You place an order  
✅ We run a clean targeting session  
✅ You receive a polished list of the right people to contact
